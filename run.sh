# Start Gunicorn, the production-ready WSGI HTTP Server for Python web applications.
# '__init__:app' specifies the Flask application instance 'app' found in the '__init__.py' module.
# '-b 0.0.0.0:"$PORT"' tells Gunicorn to bind to all network interfaces on the port
# provided by Render's $PORT environment variable. This is essential for Render
# to detect and route traffic to your application.
# 'exec' replaces the current shell process with the gunicorn process,
# ensuring signals (like SIGTERM for graceful shutdown) are correctly handled by Gunicorn.
